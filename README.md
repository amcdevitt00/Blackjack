Link to final project walkthrough video: 

Our code is fairly standard to run. 

The main problem we had when starting this project was that we overshot what we thought we were capable of. We originally wanted to include visuals of each different card, but that showed to be much too time consuming, so we stuck with a meter depicting the degree of how "hot" the deck is. It was a good feeling to be able to change plans after starting and still be pleased with the final product.
