Description of what we wanted:
The main problem we had when starting this project was that we overshot what we thought we were capable of. We originally wanted to have a camera watch a BlackJack game and report back the active concentration of high cards remaining in the deck. Additionally, we wanted to include some type of active visual or notification system, so we stuck with a meter depicting the degree of how "hot" the deck is. It was a good feeling to be able to change plans after starting and still be pleased with the final product.  

Description of waht we have:
Running the 6DeckGame.py starts an automatic BlackJack game that lists each card in 6 decks one by one and presents a thermometer and arrow graphic that changes depending on the conditions of the game. The higher the concentration of high-vlaue cards remaining in the deck is, the higher the arrow points on the thermometer and the deeper the color of the arrow becomes. 
Running the HotDeckStats.py asks for how many iterations of the 6DeckGame you would like to run and then presents the percentage of time that each advantage was observed throughout all the games. Each advantage is based on CountingEdge.com's article about True Counts in BlackJack. That article can be found here: https://www.countingedge.com/card-counting/true-count/ .

We had a lot of fun making this code and dreaming of using it in real life to turn a profit - we realized we would need a substantial amount of capital to get started.
