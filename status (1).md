Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Created a way for Dr. Liss's Poker Lab set up to create 6 shuffled decks the output one card at a time until there are no cards remaining in the deck. We have also started to create 
graphic that will change depending on how "hot" the remaining deck is. In this context, a "hot" deck refers to when the concentration of high-value cards remaining in th edeck is higher than average. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

We have yet to create a code that runs fast enough to run multiple iterations. Once we achieve this, we would like to average the amount of time different advantages are observed
and display those percentages. We would like to be able to run the game so many times that the results start to level out as we approach infinity games.


#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Creating a graphic that has a moving arrow was more difficult than just changing the hurricane lab to a new background and we are currently working through consolidating 
code so the games run as close to 0 seconds as we can get.
